							"abstract": "Oral cancer ranks as the sixth most common type of cancer worldwide, with 90% of cases in the form of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). OSCC has a high mortality rate, and early diagnosis can significantly increase the survival chances for patients. About 80% of OSCC is developed from Oral Epithelial Dysplasia (OED); thus, OED detection is vital in diagnosing and treating OSCC at its early stages. The conventional definition of OED encompasses sixteen criteria, including architectural and cytological features, meticulously evaluated through microscopic examination by expert oral pathologists. This manual detection is time-consuming and prone to human error, highlighting the need for precise automated detection of OED. However, the task of designing Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) for OED detection is known to be challenging because each criterion in OED requires a particular medical image processing task to be performed. To address this issue, we proposed a novel multi-task learning network to combine semantic segmentation and classification to detect OED based on architectural and cytological characteristics. Our approach is the first study that jointly trained semantic segmentation and classification on a single network for automated OED detection. We developed two new frameworks called VGG16-Unet and InceptionV3-Unet, which were designed based on classic U-Net with ImageNet pre-trained VGG16 and InceptionV3 encoder components, as well as traditional classifier models attached at the end of the encoder branch of U-Net. The efficacy of the proposed models was rigorously verified through quantitative metrics and visualization. The experimental results demonstrate that our novel models perform superiorly on both classification and segmentation tasks for detecting OED by achieving a high accuracy of 90.6%, a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 94.6%, a precision of 92%, an F1-score of 88.4% in classification and 84.4% of Jaccard in segmentation tasks.",

It presents enduring symptoms that significantly overlap with those of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Disorder (OSAD), such as inconsistent breathing patterns, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular complications. This paper presents an analysis of Long COVID using healthcare data from the Froedtert Health Medical System in Wisconsin. By leveraging advanced Machine Learning (ML) methodologies, we have formulated predictive models aimed at assessing the risk of OSAD onset in individuals diagnosed with Long COVID. Additionally, our study reveals critical factors influencing the incidence of OSAD. Considering recent research that underscores the increased risk of Long COVID in patients with pre-existing OSADs, this innovative research inversely investigates the likelihood of developing OSAD post-Long COVID diagnosis. We utilized the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) approach to extract salient features that substantially impact OSAD from our dataset. To counter the dataset's underlying imbalance, we implemented the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors (SMOTEEN) strategy. We experimented with multiple ML models and validated them using cross-validation techniques. The results indicate that the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier exhibits superior performance, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.967, precision of 0.942, and recall of 0.929. Random Forest (RF) classifier also demonstrates robust predictive capabilities for OSAD risk prediction, achieving an AUC of 0.964, precision of 0.936, and recall of 0.918.

An important type of OCD is touching the face intentionally / unintentionally, particularly when in deep thinking. Examples include pulling hair, rubbing eyes, pinching pimples, vaping, and scratching the chin. Such a constant urge can easily transmit germs and may also become vulnerable for disabled and older adults. Although there are several work that uses machine learning algorithms to identify human activities, there is very limited work on detecting face touch with the raw accelerometer data. There are multiple challenges to using accelerometer data for machine learning algorithms like noise and data dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework Deep-Accel to predict face touching activities compared to other human activities. We give an in-depth analysis of the proposed framework and show that it achieves up to 79.6% accuracy in classifying face touching activities and up to 73.2% in classifying all activities. ",

Although there are several work that uses machine learning algorithms to identify human activities, there is very limited work on detecting face touch with the raw accelerometer data. There are multiple challenges to using accelerometer data for machine learning algorithms like noise and data dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework Deep-Accel to predict face touching activities compared to other human activities. We give an in-depth analysis of the proposed framework and show that it achieves up to 79.6% accuracy in classifying face touching activities and up to 73.2% in classifying all activities.",

Then, using only the data sets from actual production, a model for the wear is trained in a feature-based approach. The most relevant features for detecting wear are selected using a filter feature selection approach. Afterwards, an estimator for the wear is determined from the selected features by multivariate regression. A comparison of the results of two different sensor systems shows, that the sensor data already available for process monitoring can be reused for this purpose and that no additional sensor system needs to be installed.",

							"abstract": "Choroidal nevus often appears as a darkly pigmented, benign ocular lesion, which may progress to malignant forms, such as choroidal melanoma. Prompt and precise diagnosis of choroidal melanoma cannot be overstated as untreated cases can lead to vision loss and even life-threatening metastasis, underscoring the importance of regular screening of the eye. However, this procedure is performed manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to human errors. Recent advancements in deep learning show potential for detecting eye diseases, including choroidal nevi. However, these models require extensive labelled data, which can be difficult to acquire due to the associated labelling costs. In this paper, we utilize two approaches to tackle these challenges. Firstly, we leverage a pre-trained YOLOv8 segmentation model and train it on both patches and full-size high-resolution colour fundus images. This strategy effectively expands the dataset size and allows the model to focus on the fine details of lesions within individual patches while understanding the general shape of the lesions by analyzing the entire image. Secondly, we use data augmentation to further expand the dataset size and tackle the class imbalance problem. Additionally, through the utilization of post-processing techniques, we enhance the predicted masks by addressing any potential flaws. This approach resulted in a 0.833 Dice Coefficient Score and a 0.714 Intersection Over Union (IOU) in our initial dataset and a Dice score of 0.764 and IOU of 0.618 on our second test set collected from a different site.

Early detection of this disease can play an important role in the effectiveness of the treatment process. The diagnosis is usually monitored from chest X-ray images by an expert radiologist. Due to a lack of confidence in the diagnosis process regarding ambiguous X-ray images or being mistaken for other medical diseases, the application of computer vision is needed to assist radiologists in the decision-making process. In this study, we utilized techniques from transfer learning alongside three architectures based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to facilitate the detection of pneumonia and improve the interpretability of diagnostic outcomes. To achieve this, we used a publicly available dataset of 5,863 grayscale chest X-ray images. These images include standard anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral views obtained from unique patients from Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center in China (1,583 normal and 4,280 pneumonia images). Before the training, validation, and testing phases, data preprocessing techniques including image resizing and data augmentation were used to prepare the dataset for binary classification. To enhance the generalizability and efficacy of our findings, we utilized high-performing pre-trained models such as DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and ResNet101, evaluating the performance of each architecture against an external validation, and test set.

Therefore, effective assessment and support of children's language development are paramount. Among the various assessment tools, language sample analysis stands out as a key method. This involves experts collecting, transcribing, and analyzing children's language samples to evaluate their language development. The present study endeavors to merge language sample analysis with artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning technology to establish a classification model capable of discerning between children with normal development and those potentially facing language-related challenges. To achieve this goal, the study leverages the ASDBank and CHILDES as data sources, representing children with potential language issues and those with typical development, respectively. Through a series of processes, the corpus undergoes language sample analysis, yielding eight characteristic indicators (MLU-w, MLU-c, MLU5-w, MLU5-c, CTTR-w, CTTR-c, VOCD-D, VOCD-c). Utilizing these indicators as model features, synthetic data technology is employed to address data insufficiency, resulting in the generation of six combined datasets, totaling 1,000 data points, with 854 entries of 91.50% quality. Subsequently, a supervised machine learning classification model is constructed utilizing Bayesian classification, random forest, and gradient boosting machine methods. Considering the appropriate quantity of synthetic data generated and overall model evaluation performance, the random forest model constructed emerges as the optimal classification model, yielding highest accuracy (0.76), sensitivity (0.94), and F1-score (0.85).

To evaluate the performance of the newly created labels, we train a supervised classifier and evaluate its classification performance and compare it to an unsupervised anomaly detection method as a baseline. Our empirical findings indicate that the generated class labels are of high enough quality and enable effective supervised classifier training for fraud detection. Additionally, supervised classification with the new labels consistently outperforms the baseline used for comparison across all test scenarios.

Machine learning, particularly deep learning (DL) models trained with time-lapse incubator (TLI) video images, can improve the success rates of infertility treatments by providing valuable morphokinetic parameters for embryo assessment. This paper introduces two novel DL algorithms for TLI image analysis: Algorithm_1 is based on instance segmentation to train two different YOLOv5 models, doing so helps enhance the efficacy of segmenting cells of trophectoderm (TE), achieving 81.1% recall and 79.9% precision. Results of YOLOv5 are also used to count TE cells and quantify the area ratio of ICM and TE vs. blastocyst. Based on cell texture changes, we apply GLCM analysis of ICM images to distinguish Gardner grades A and B. Algorithm_2 uses confidence level to determine the time point (CDTP) with three separate ResNet50-based models for identifying tSB, tB, and tEB, respectively. With 94% accuracy, timestamps of tSB, tB, and tEB are identified and compared with the machine-marked stamps by the original maker. Our method gives an average time difference of 1.99 hours from the ground truth, much less than the 3.87 hours by VitrolifeTM.

Research, however, suggests that a large share of the answers on Stack Overflow include vulnerable code and their use in a software system may cause major security implications. Researchers have suggested several approaches, e.g., leveraging software metrics, to predict vulnerability in the source code. The majority of these approaches require the whole code base or a big chunk of it to perform the prediction. The answers on those Q&A websites, however, are code snippets typically with a single function, or, at most a couple of related functions. Predicting vulnerabilities in such code snippets has received limited attention. Few examples present in the literature suggest leveraging function-level software metrics to predict vulnerable code. Such work, however, provides incomplete analysis with heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper examines whether function-level code metrics can differentiate the vulnerable and fixed versions of a given function. In particular, we develop a \"near-balanced\" dataset with a total of 132,754 function instances, calculate 18 function-level code metrics for both vulnerable (49.6% of the total) and fixed versions of the functions, and conduct binary logistic regression with the Wald test. The results suggest that function-level code metrics may not be useful in predicting if a given function contains vulnerability.",

							"abstract": "This study employs machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) in the field of disease detection and management while focusing on Thai language texts. We have introduced two innovative text oversampling methods to address the challenges associated with imbalanced datasets in medical diagnostics: Text Oversampling Using Keyword Selection and Text Oversampling Using Synonym Words. The Keyword Selection method identifies and selectively removes specific misspelled words and stop words, while the Synonym Words method replaces certain words with their synonyms, thereby enhancing data quality and the effectiveness of model training. Our approach utilizes unstructured data obtained from electronic health records. It addresses the complex issue of symptomatic overlap for certain diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever, common migraine, common cold, influenza, and tonsillitis. The concept of symptomatic overlap presents significant challenges in achieving accurate disease diagnoses. This study primarily focused on the Saraphi Hospital dataset, which was characterized by a high imbalance ratio. Notably, the Keyword Selection method demonstrated superior performance over other techniques in terms of the f1-score, underscoring its efficacy. By reducing data complexity and preventing overfitting, the Keyword Selection method enhanced the accuracy of disease classification. Our findings suggest that these novel oversampling methods can significantly improve the process of disease identification and management, marking an important advancement in the integration of machine learning in disease detection.",

However, capturing this gaze information using traditional eye trackers often requires complex and costly experimental setups. Furthermore, conventional eye-tracking algorithms are catered for single-user scenarios and cannot be used for multi-user environments. We propose Multi-Eyes, a commodity webcam-based solution offering scalability and cost-efficiency while leveraging the advancements in deep learning for capturing multi-user gaze. Multi-Eyes propose a three-step multi-user eye tracking framework that (1) detects gaze subjects, (2) estimates gaze, and (3) maps gaze-to-screen with a scalable, memory, and parameter-efficient disentangled gaze estimation model. We evaluate the gaze estimation model using two publicly available datasets and the framework's utility through a joint-attention case study. Our proposed architecture achieves the lowest gaze error of 4.33, while the case study demonstrates the feasibility of the Multi-Eyes for multi-user interactions and joint attention with comparable results to the state-of-the-art.",
